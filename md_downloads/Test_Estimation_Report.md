**üìùTest Estimation Report**

## **1. Introduction**

This document provides an estimation of testing effort, resources, and
timelines for the upcoming release of the web application. The
estimation covers both **Functional** and **Non-Functional Testing**
activities. It also highlights assumptions, risks, and dependencies
considered during estimation.

## **2. Objectives**

- Provide effort and resource estimates for Functional and
  Non-Functional testing.

- Define the scope and assumptions for estimation.

- Identify risks and mitigation plans related to testing effort.

- Establish a baseline for test planning and execution.

## **3. Scope of Testing**

### **3.1 Functional Testing**

- Requirement Validation

- Test Case Design & Review

- Functional Test Execution

- Regression Testing

- Defect Reporting & Retesting

### **3.2 Non-Functional Testing**

- Performance & Load Testing

- Security Testing

- Compatibility (Cross-Browser & Device) Testing

- Usability Testing

- Accessibility Testing

## **4. Estimation Approach**

The following methods were used:

- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** -- breaking down into granular
  tasks.

- **Historical Data** -- based on past project velocity & defect
  density.

- **Three-Point Estimation (PERT Formula)** -- for uncertain activities.

- **Expert Judgment** -- input from QA leads and SMEs.

  **Risk**                  **Impact**   **Mitigation**
  ------------------------- ------------ -------------------------------------
  Delayed environment       High         Request early provisioning; fallback
  readiness                              to lower env.

  Scope creep in            Medium       Re-baseline estimation after CR
  requirements                           approval.

  Limited performance       High         Early performance testing cycles;
  testing window                         monitoring post go-live.

  Test data unavailability  Medium       Use synthetic data generation tools.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **10. Conclusion & Recommendation**

Based on the estimation approach and breakdown, a total of **75
Person-Days** effort is required to complete both Functional and
Non-Functional testing activities. Adequate resource allocation, stable
environments, and timely data availability are critical for meeting this
estimation.
