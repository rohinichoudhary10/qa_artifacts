# 1. Introduction

This document defines the overall test strategy for the UK Banking &
Financial Solution Application. The purpose is to ensure the application
meets functional, security, performance, and compliance requirements in
alignment with UK FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), PSD2 (Payment
Services Directive 2), and GDPR regulations.\
\
**PSD2 Overview:** PSD2 is a UK/EU regulation designed to make online
payments more secure, enable third-party financial service providers via
secure APIs, and encourage innovation in the banking sector. It mandates
Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and secure data sharing through
open banking API.

# 2. Scope

## 2.1 In-Scope

- Functional testing of retail, corporate, and investment banking
  modules.

- API and integration testing with payment gateways, credit bureaus, and
  financial data providers.

- Regression Testing

- Accessibility, Cross browser & responsiveness testing

- Regulatory compliance testing (FCA, PSD2, GDPR).

- Security testing for authentication, authorization, and data
  encryption.

- Performance, load, and stress testing.

- Penetration testing

**PSD2 Compliance Checklist:**

1.  Strong Customer Authentication (SCA): Validate 2FA or MFA during
    payments.

2.  Secure API Access: Verify OAuth2 or similar token-based
    authentication for third-party apps.

3.  Consent Management: Ensure customers can give and revoke consent to
    third parties.

4.  Transaction Integrity: Confirm data is not altered in transit.

5.  Timeouts & Session Management: Enforce time-based session expiry.

6.  Audit Logs: Ensure all access and transactions are logged for
    compliance.

##  2.2 Out-of-Scope

- Third-party system internal testing outside integration points.

- Hardware testing not related to application deployment.

# 3. Test Objectives

- Validate all functional requirements as per business specifications.

- Ensure compliance with UK banking regulations.

- Validate system security against OWASP (Open web application security
  project) Top 10 vulnerabilities.

- Confirm system stability and scalability under expected transaction
  loads.

- Ensure compatibility with supported browsers, devices, and operating
  systems.

# 4. Test Design Approach

- **Select Design Techniques**

  - **Equivalence Partitioning** -- Grouping test cases to reduce
    redundancy.

  - **Boundary Value Analysis** -- Focusing on limits of input ranges.

  - **Decision Table Testing** -- For complex business rules.

  - **State Transition Testing** -- For workflows and transaction
    states.

  - **Use Case Testing** -- Based on real-world user interactions.

- **Create Test Scenarios**

  - High-level functional flows.

  - Include cross-functional and end-to-end process scenarios.

- **Write Detailed Test Cases**

  - Steps, expected results, preconditions, test data.

  - Ensure **reusability** and **clear pass/fail criteria**.

- **Review & Sign-off**

  - Peer review by QA team.

  - Business Analyst validation for requirement coverage.

  - Automation team review for script readiness.

- **Traceability**

  - Maintain **Requirement Traceability Matrix** linking requirements to
    scenarios and cases.

  - Ensure coverage gaps are visible and addressed.

- **Version Control**

  - Store test cases in a centralized, version-controlled repository.

  - Maintain historical records for audits (important in BFSI).

## 5.2 Testing Types

The following testing types will be executed to ensure complete coverage
of functional and non-functional aspects:

- **Functional Testing** -- Validates that the application behaves
  according to business requirements and specifications.

- **Regression Testing** -- Ensures that new code changes do not
  introduce defects into previously working functionality.

- **API Testing** -- Verifies that all internal and external APIs
  function correctly, return accurate data, and handle errors
  gracefully.

- **Security Testing** -- Identifies vulnerabilities, ensures data
  protection, and verifies compliance with OWASP Top 10 security
  standards.

- **Performance Testing** -- Evaluates system responsiveness,
  scalability, and stability under normal and peak load conditions.

- **Accessibility Testing** -- Ensures compliance with WCAG (Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines) so the application is usable by individuals
  with disabilities.

- **Cross-Browser Testing** -- Confirms consistent functionality and UI
  rendering across supported browsers and devices.

- **Compliance Testing** -- Validates adherence to industry regulations
  such as FCA, PSD2, and GDPR.

##  5.3 Methodology 

A risk-based testing approach will be adopted, prioritizing test
execution based on the likelihood and potential business impact of
defects.

- High-risk areas (e.g., payment processing, customer data security)
  will receive maximum coverage and early test execution.

- Testing activities will follow an iterative process, with continuous
  feedback loops between development, QA, and business teams.

- Agile principles will be followed where applicable, allowing early
  defect detection and quicker adaptation to changes in requirements.

##  5.4 Defect Management

Defect management will be performed using standardized processes to
ensure transparency and traceability:

- All defects will be logged and tracked in a defect/test management
  tool such as **JIRA, TestRail, DevPlus, or Jile**.

- Defects will be triaged based on **severity and priority**, ensuring
  critical issues are addressed first.

- Defect lifecycle stages (New → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed →
  Retested → Closed) will be strictly followed.

- Detailed defect reports will be shared with stakeholders during daily
  stand-ups and weekly status meetings.

                          Manager                 relevant developer or
                                                  development team for
                                                  resolution.

  In Progress             Developer               Starts working on
                                                  fixing the defect.

  Fixed                   Developer               Marks the defect as
                                                  fixed and provides the
                                                  build for testing.

  Retest                  Retest                  Verifies the fix in the
                                                  specified build to
                                                  ensure the defect no

                          Product Owner           future release due to
                                                  low impact or
                                                  constraints.

  Rejected                Developer / Test Lead   Marks defect as invalid
                                                  or not reproducible.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##  5.5 Automation

Automation will be used to improve efficiency and ensure repeatable,
consistent testing:

- **Regression and Smoke Testing** -- Automated using **Selenium
  WebDriver with Java** and integrated with TestNG for execution
  management.

- **API Testing** -- Automated using **Postman** and command-line
  execution via **Newman**, with assertions for both functional and
  negative test cases.

- **Performance Testing** -- Conducted using **Apache JMeter** to
  simulate concurrent user loads and monitor system response times.

- Automation scripts will be version-controlled in a Git repository,
  with CI/CD integration for scheduled or on-demand execution.

##  5.6 Test Data

Test data will be carefully managed to ensure both relevance and
compliance:

- **Masked Production Data** -- Real production data will be anonymized
  to remove personally identifiable information (PII) in compliance with
  **GDPR**.

- **Synthetic Test Data** -- Artificially generated data sets will be
  created for edge cases, negative testing, and scenarios not found in
  production.

- Test data refresh cycles will be defined to ensure accuracy and
  consistency across test environments.

- Secure storage and controlled access policies will be applied to all
  test data.

# 6. Test Environment

- **Environments**: Dev, SIT, UAT, Pre-Prod, Prod.

- **Configurations**: Windows/Linux/Mac servers, MS SQL database, AWS
  cloud hosting.

- **Access Controls:** Role-based access; only authorized users allowed
  in restricted test environments.

- **Data Management:** GDPR-compliant anonymization for customer data.
