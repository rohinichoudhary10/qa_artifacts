### **What Went Well ‚úÖ**

- Comprehensive test planning and execution aligned with project
  milestones.

- Early involvement of QA team in requirement analysis, reducing late
  surprises.

- Effective collaboration between QA, Development, and Business teams
  ensured faster defect resolution.

- Test environments were stable and available on time for execution.

- End-to-end regression and user acceptance testing validated key
  business flows before go-live.

### **Challenges Faced ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Delays in receiving stable builds impacted regression timelines.

- Limited test data availability for certain real-time integration
  scenarios.

- Inconsistent communication on last-minute requirement changes.

- Performance testing cycles were shortened due to schedule constraints.

- Some environment-related defects were identified late, causing rework.

### **Improvements for Future üîß**

- Implement shift-left approach with QA validation starting from
  requirement/user story grooming.

- Automate regression and smoke tests to save time during frequent build
  deployments.

- Establish a dedicated Test Data Management strategy to simulate
  real-world scenarios.

- Strengthen performance and security testing earlier in the lifecycle.

- Set up continuous monitoring dashboards post-go-live for quicker
  defect detection in production.
