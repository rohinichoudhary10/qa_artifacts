**Observation:** All critical and high-severity defects have been
closed. Medium and low-severity issues are either fixed or deferred to
the next release.

## **5. Risks & Mitigation**

- **Risk:** Limited time for performance testing.

  - *Mitigation:* Continuous monitoring planned post go-live.

- **Risk:** Minor UI defects deferred.

  - *Mitigation:* Fixes scheduled in the next release patch.

- **Risk:** Dependency on third-party API response times.

  - *Mitigation:* SLA agreement and fallback mechanism implemented.

## **6. Lessons Learnt**

### **What Went Well ‚úÖ**

- Strong collaboration between QA, Dev, and Business teams.

- Early involvement of QA in requirement reviews.

- Stable test environment availability.

### **Challenges Faced ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Delays in receiving stable builds.

- Limited test data for edge-case scenarios.

- Performance testing window was shortened.

### **Improvements for Future üîß**

- Automate smoke/regression packs for faster cycles.

- Strengthen Test Data Management process.

- Start performance/security testing earlier in the lifecycle.

## **7. QA Sign-Off**

Based on the testing performed, defect resolution, and UAT approval, the
QA team recommends sign-off for the web application go-live.
